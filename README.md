# WRO Future Engineers Getting Started

This repository contains a set of materials to help studends and their coaches to start preparing to the WRO Future Engineers competition.

The WRO Future Engineers is the competition of the self-driven vehicles. Students of the age group from 15 till 19 need to design a model of a car, equip it with electromechanical components and program it as so it will be able to autonomously drive on the track avoiding objections.

More details about the competition can be found on [the official site of WRO Association](https://wro-association.org/competition/new-competition-formats/future-engineers).
